==========

==========
1. Open a new terminal window.
[NO OUTPUT]
----------
==========
2. In your home directory, start editing a text file called temp.txt using nano.

Write the command you used to do this below.
----------
nano temp.txt


==========
3. Open another terminal

[NO OUTPUT]
----------
==========
3. In this terminal, show (list) all running processes / programs.

Write the command that you used to do this, and the last two lines of output.
----------
ps

 1648 ttys001    0:00.00 nano temp.txt
 1651 ttys002    0:00.01 -bash

==========
4. Run the same command, but look for a specific process.  (It's the version of the command that has | grep ...).  Look for the program that you started to edit a file, nano.

Write the command that you used to do this, and all of the output.
----------
ps aux | grep -i nano

student          1648   0.0  0.0  2433028   1152 s001  S+    1:11PM   0:00.00 nano temp.txt
student          1667   0.0  0.0  2432784    672 s002  S+    1:16PM   0:00.00 grep -i nano
==========
5. Stop (kill) the process that's called nano "temp.txt" by using the process id shown in the output of your previous command (first number after user name).

----------
kill 1648

==========
6. Go to your other terminal window.  What happened to nano?  What was the message on the screen?

----------
Window went away. Message is: 
Received SIGHUP or SIGTERM
==========
7. Close the terminal window that nano was in, and go back to the terminal where you ran ps.

[NO OUTPUT]
----------


==========
8. Now... using nano, create a shell script in your home directory called hello.sh.  It should contain the following text exactly:

#!/bin/bash
echo "hi there!"

Quit and save when you're done.

What command did you use to do this?
----------
touch hello.sh
nano hello.sh
^X
y
==========
9. Change the permissions (modify) on hello.sh so that the *user* (u) can *execute* (x) it: 

Write the commands that you used to do this below.
----------
chmod u+x hello.sh

==========
10. Run your script (hello.sh).

How did you do this?  What was the output?
----------
./hello.sh

Hi There!
==========
11. Change to the root directory.  Try running your script again (hello.sh).  What was the output (if there's an error, write it out)?
----------
-bash: ./hello.sh: No such file or directory

==========
12. Now trying using the full, absolute path to your script (that is, starting with /...).  What did you write in?  What did it do?
----------
/Users/student/hello.sh

Hi There!
==========
13.  Go back to the directory that your hello.sh script was in.  What command did you use to change to this directory? 
----------
cd ~

==========
14. Type in the following command:

echo $PATH

Write down the output of this command
----------
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin

==========
15. Type in the following command to show all environment variables:

env

Write down the last two lines of output for this command
----------
_=/usr/bin/env
OLDPWD=/Users/student

==========
16. Set your PATH to include your home directory.  Do the following (substituting student or username for professor)

PATH=$PATH:/Users/professor

Now check your path again.

echo $PATH

Write down the output of the last command.  It should include your home folder.
----------
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Users/student

==========
17.  Go back to root (/)

Try running your script simply by typing

hello.sh

It should work now!  What is the output?
----------
Hi There!

==========
18.  Save this file in the repository that you created from parts 1 and 2.

Add and commit it to your local repository and push to the remote repository.  Check github to see that your work was submitted.
----------


==========
19.  Optional - Try writing this shell script!

In your repository, create an executable shell script called make_5_files that creates 10 files in the directory that it's called in.  The file names should be:
myfile1.txt
myfile2.txt
.
myfile10.txt

Use a for loop to do this.  Add and save in your repository, push to the remote.
----------


==========
20.  Optional - Try writing this shell script!

In your repository, create an executable shell script called say_twice.  It should take one argument - a filename.  It will cat out the contents of that file twice, with a row of dashes between each (use cat, echo... then cat again).  Create a test file calle foo.txt ... that contains foo, bar and baz... each on separate lines.

Add and save in your repository, push to the remote.
